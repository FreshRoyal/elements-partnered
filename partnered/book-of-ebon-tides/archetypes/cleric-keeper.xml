			<p>The Keeper domain focuses on social bonds and well-regulated communities. These communities might be as small as an adventuring party or as large as a city, but all require safety and comfort to thrive. Keeper domain clerics excel in leadership positions and are the first to take up arms when their homes or allies need protection.</p>
