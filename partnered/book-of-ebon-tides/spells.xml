		<description>
			<p>Freezing wind, forming a line 120 feet long and 20 feet wide, blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 30 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Creatures that fail the saving throw also take 1d12 cold damage and are knocked prone. If cast during cold weather or in dark or shadowy conditions, the saving throw is made with disadvantage. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</p>
            <p class="indent">The bitter wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, lanterns, and similar flames in the area.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the saving throw is made with disadvantage, and the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

For the duration, you can use a bonus action to draw a blade made of your own bone, blood, and sinew from your body.

On a roll of 11-20, you take the form of a humanoid made of bone-chilling darkness.

		<description>
			<p>When standing on a riverbank or on the shore of some other body of water, you summon a ferry spirit and its boat, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The spirit is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It takes you and up to 1 companion per your level across the river or body of water (no action required by you) or to other locations along the same water. If you don't issue any such commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your concentration is broken, the ferry and its guide don't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the conjured spirit, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled ferryman can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p>
			<p class="indent">The GM has the ferry spirit's statistics (using those for lesser lunar devil or bearded devil).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the boat can take you and your companions across a planar boundary into the Ethereal Plane and then exit on another body of water (and using a barbed devil). When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, it can traverse the River Styx between planes, taking you and your companions to distant parts of the multiverse (and using a lunar devil, see Tome of Beasts, or bone devil).</p>

The rays can be divided between targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals 1d10 cold damage.

			<p>You bind shadow material into an enchanted fey road, fixing its path between two points so as to hold against ordinary weather and mundane alteration and to stretch and bend in shadow tides. This is called a shadow road, and it is subject to normal wear, to destruction by those with the tools to break it, and to magical destruction by hostile forces, such as by <i>dispel magic</i>.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you wish, the spell may include a prayer or offering that serves as a keyword. This secret of the road allows anyone who knows and uses it to add one or two effects to the road, such as faster travel on the road (up to double the overland speed usually permitted) or locking and unlocking the road's portals outside of the Shadow Realm. Those who do not know the prayer, ritual, or offering cannot enter the road from outside of the Shadow Realm.</p>

			<p>You sever the bonds of friendship and affection between your targets. Target two creatures of your choice within range that can hear and see you. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target must use its movement and action to move toward and attack the other target of the spell. If an unaffected target of the spell moves out of range, the other target must make every effort to find and attack it. At the end of each turn that one of the targets cannot see the other target, it can make a new saving throw, overcoming the compulsion on a successful save.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You turn luck against a creature of your choice within range. When the target makes an ability check, they must first make a Charisma saving throw or the check fails. This spell persists once cast, even if the target moves out of range. If cast with a higher-level slot, each subsequent effect is added to the effect noted above.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target ultimately succeeds on the check (or saving throw or attack at higher levels), then you take 1 psychic damage. If you ever lose concentration on the spell, you take 1d4 psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, when the target is required to make a saving throw, it must make a Charisma saving throw in place of the required one, unless the required one is more difficult to make. When you cast this spell with a 4th-level slot, when the target makes an attack roll, it must make a Charisma saving throw prior to making the attack. On a failed save, the attack fails. If you cast this spell with an 8th level slot, this spell persists for the duration without requiring concentration.</p>

			<p>You rapidly reduce the age of your target. Choose a living creature within range. At the time the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns, your target must make a Constitution saving throw, decreasing 1d4 + 1 years in age on a successful save or 1 year on a failed one. A target ceases the de-aging process once it is reduced to infancy. A creature that is reduced in age retains all of its memories, ability scores, and features, but it gains 1 level of exhaustion for each 5 years it is reduced in age. A Medium creature reduced to childhood cannot use weapons with the heavy property. A Medium creature reduced to infancy cannot wield weapons or use tools. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reverts to its true age. Otherwise, the targets is permanently reduced to its new age. Remove curse and greater restoration can be used to return a creature to its true age.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on the spell, you gain levels in exhaustion equal to what the target gained from this spell.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You generate a wave of shadow matter at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, black winds and currents of shadow matter whip in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point, modifying terrain and sometimes drowning creatures in the area. The area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature touching the ground must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains a level of exhaustion. When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p>
			<p class="indent">The ebon tide deals 30 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it sinks into the earth, consumed by the Shadow Realm. Any creature within a structure when it sinks must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d12 necrotic damage, is knocked prone, and is blinded for 1 round. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become blinded.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM. No more than two of the following effects can be the result of one casting of ebon tide.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hills and Hollows.</i></b> Ground rises or sinks throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. These changes take the form of a hill, a slip fault (a new cliff), or a hollow. A total of 1d4 such hills, slip faults, or hollows open in locations chosen by the GM. A hollow or slip fault that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see above). A hollow or hill can alter the flow of local water, such as a moat, stream, or lake.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Rivers, Shores, and Waters.</i></b> Water in the area can adopt an old course (such as an oxbow) or be swept into a new one, starting at the start of your next turn after you cast this spell. Only one such water element can be altered by the casting of this spell. (You cannot alter both a lake and a stream feeding it, for instance.)</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Shadow Mire.</i></b> All ground in the area of the spell becomes shadow mire (see Chapter 5 of Book of Ebon Tides) for the duration.</p>

		<supports>Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Spell Saving Throw</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This spell instantly summons a glittering moonbeam that transports one sleeping creature or object of your choice that you can see within range to a destination you select. If you target an unwilling creature, it gains a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell fails, and the caster appears in the target location instead. A transferred creature wakes up as soon as it arrives at its destination. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether the creature or object arrives there successfully.</p>
			<p class="indent">The GM rolls d20 and consults the Lunar Transfer table below. The following definitions will help:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Grove or Magic Circle</b> means a hallowed druid grove or a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.</li>
				<li><b>Memento</b> means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.</li>
				<li><b>Very Familiar</b> is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.</li>
				<li><b>Seen Casually</b> is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.</li>
				<li><b>Viewed Once</b> is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic.</li>
				<li><b>Description</b> is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.</li>
				<li><b>False Destination</b> is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or perhaps you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>On Target.</i></b> The target creature or object appears where you want it to.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Off Target.</i></b> The target creature or object appears a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 5 miles times a 1d20 roll, though never more than half the distance traveled. For example, if you sent someone 250 miles and they landed off target, and you rolled an 8 on the d20, then they would arrive off target by 40 miles. If you had sent them only 20 miles, they could not be more than 10 miles off target. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting someone to a coastal city and they wound up 20 miles out at sea, they could be in trouble.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Similar.</i></b> Your target creature or object winds up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are sending someone to your home laboratory, for example, they might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, the creature or object appears in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, they could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Mishap.</i></b> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. The teleporting creature or object takes 2d12 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up. (Multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time.)</p>

			<p>You conjure a portal or doorway that links an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location in the mortal or fey realmsâ€”such as Midgard, the Shadow Realm, or the Summer Landsâ€”that you have stood. The portal is a semicircular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameterâ€”it is often cast under a bridge, archway, or even under roots or branches of a large tree. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. It has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. The portal lasts for the duration.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> If cast using a 5th-level or higher spell slot, you may make the portal last for 1 week after you create it.

				<li>Strobing lights flash briefly before your target's eyes, causing difficulties with its vision. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or its passive Perception is halved until the end of its next turn.</li>
				<li>The target feels the sensation of a quick, mild clap against its ears, briefly disorienting it. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration.</li>
				<li>An invisible force sharply tugs on the target's trousers, causing their clothing to slip. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw.
