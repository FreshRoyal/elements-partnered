	<element name="Requiem Bliss" type="Item" source="Book of Ebon Tides" id="ID_KBP_BOET_ITEM_REQUIEM_BLISS">
		<description>
			<p>When you smoke requiem bliss, you experience feelings of euphoria. You summon the spirit of a single deceased person whose name you know. The spirit takes on the physical characteristics it had in life and might touch you, though it cannot harm you. You can ask the spirit questions as the <i>speak with dead</i> spell with the following exceptions: you can ask up to ten questions, and the spirit cannot lie to you. In addition, you are simultaneously granted the benefit of the <i>contact other plane</i> spell (without taking psychic damage or going insane) as the summoned spirit consults with others and relates information about a single question that would otherwise be unknown to it.</p>
			<p class="indent">You suffer 3 (1d6) poison damage per question asked and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 + 1 per question asked) or become addicted to the drug.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you become addicted, you suffer two levels of exhaustion 1d4 days after you last smoked the drug and gain a further level of exhaustion for each week that requiem is not smoked. Levels of exhaustion gained through requiem use do not reduce as normal after taking a long rest. Smoking requiem again eliminates levels of exhaustion gained from abstaining.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of each week, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Three consecutive weekly successful saving throws are necessary to break the addiction through abstinence. Alternatively, the addiction can be broken with a <i>lesser restoration</i> or <i>heal</i> spell.</p>

	<element name="Requiem Clay" type="Item" source="Book of Ebon Tides" id="ID_KBP_BOET_ITEM_REQUIEM_CLAY">
		<description>
			<p>When you smoke requiem clay, you summon the spirit of a single deceased person that you personally knew in life. The spirit's image is visible, and its voice can be heard in whispers, but it cannot touch you. You can ask the spirit up to five questions, as the <i>speak with dead</i> spell. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the spirit is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or if it recognizes you as an enemy. The spirit can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.</p>
			<p class="indent">Afterward, you suffer 3 (1d6) poison damage per question asked and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + 1 per question asked) or become addicted to the drug. If you become addicted, you suffer one level of exhaustion 1d4 days after you last smoked the drug and gain a further level of exhaustion for each week that requiem is not smoked. Levels of exhaustion gained through requiem use do not reduce as normal after taking a long rest. Smoking requiem again eliminates levels of exhaustion gained from abstaining.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of each week, you can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Two consecutive weekly successful saving throws are necessary to break the addiction through abstinence. Alternatively, the addiction can be broken with a <i>lesser restoration</i> or <i>heal</i> spell.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This cloak is made of fine ermine and often embellished with fasteners or trimmed with gold or embroidered orange candles, suns, or similar symbols.

			<p class="indent">In addition, while wearing the cloak, you can use your action to generate a set of 10 magical lights once per day, each as bright as a lantern and shedding full sunlight in a 20-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any or all the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 30 feet of another light created by this cloak, and a light winks out if travels more than 100 feet from you.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You have resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
				<li>You can spend one Hit Die during a short rest to remove one level of exhaustion instead of regaining hit points.</li>
				<li>You can use an action to become a living shadow.

		<description>
			<p>These boots are usually made of heavy, sturdy leatherâ€”perhaps it's demon hide or some other planar creature's hide. While wearing these boots, you can walk over any body of water as if it were normal terrain, and you can slide or skate over relatively calm waters, snow, ice, sand, magma, or other smooth surfaces at double your normal walking speed. If the snow or ice is on a hill, you move at triple your normal walking speed. You can still use the Dash action normally as well.</p>
			<p class="indent">When combined with the Armor of the Black River, the <i>Styx boots</i> permit you to use any branch of the River Styx and other planar waterways as a form of shadow road. Once per week, you can walk on such a planar waterway for 8 hours and arrive at any other plane of your choosing.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This seed must be used outdoors, and when thrown, you gain control of the weather within a 5-mile radius for up to 1d8 hours. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind, shifting the weather within 30 minutes, for instance, from a clear day to a cloudy and rainy one, from warm to arctic cold, and from moderate winds to a storm. The effects of a rain and thunder seed must always make the weather less pleasant than they were before: colder, rainier, and windier, never the reverse. While the seed often produces thunder, any lightning does not strike near you, but neither is the lightning under your control.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A <i>tavern seed</i> must be used outdoors, and when thrown, it creates a small, snug tavern of stone and wood, roughly 40 feet by 20 feet, with a lower public floor and an upper floor devoted to the staff bedchambers, storage, and a single room for rent. The entire building takes on an outward style of architecture, materials, roofing, and appearance as suits the region where it stands.

	<element name="Book of Ebon Tides" type="Magic Item" source="Book of Ebon Tides" id="ID_KBP_BOET_MAGIC_ITEM_BOOK_OF_EBON_TIDES">
		<description>
			<p>This strange twilight-hued tome was written on pages of pure shadow weave, bound in traditional birchboard covers, wrapped with shadow goblin hide, and imbued with the memories of forests in the Shadow Realm. Its covers often dance with shadows as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and shadow fey.</p>
			<p class="indent">The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ebon Tides.</em></strong> f you spend 100 hours over a period of 30 days or more studying the volume, you can perform a magical ritual to shift the structure of the Shadow Realm in particular ways. At any point after your study completes, you can expend 5 of the book's charges while spending 1 minute concentrating and performing invocations to transform the terrain near you. You don't need to repeat the study to use this property again. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the table below for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected. Built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an <strong>overshadow</strong> (see <i>Tome of Beasts 2</i> or substitute with ghost) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options.</p>
			<p class="indent">Deities, fey lords and ladies, archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Shadow Realm can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shadow Lore.</em></strong> If you spend 10 minutes referencing this book while researching the Shadow Realm or its creatures, you double your proficiency bonus on Arcana, History, and Religion checks to recall lore about such subjects for the next 24 hours. If you don't have proficiency in these skills, you instead gain proficiency in them for the next 24 hours, but you are only proficient when recalling information about the subjects of your research. This research can be done during a short rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While holding the book, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: <i>cloak of shadow</i> (1 charge), <i>darkness</i> (2 charges), <i>mirror image</i> (2 charges), <i>phantasmal killer</i> (4 charges), <i>see invisibility</i> (2 charges), <i>seeming</i> (5 charges), <i>shadow gateway</i> (5 charges), <i>shadow step</i> (4 charges), or <i>slither</i> (2 charges). You can also use an action to cast the <i>douse light</i> or <i>minor illusion</i> cantrips from the book without using any charges.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Retributive Shadows.</em></strong> You can use an action to speak a special command word and rip the book in half. The book is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in a wave of shadow magic. Four 10-foot cubes of shadow move outward from the book in the cardinal directions, and each cube moves up to 20 feet each round, away from the point where the book was destroyed. This effect works like the <i>creeping darkness</i> (see <i>Deep Magic</i>) spell, except it creates four cubes instead of three, and the necrotic damage dealt by the spell increases by 1d6 for each charge remaining in the book. At the GM's discretion, this effect can work like the <i>incendiary cloud</i> spell instead of the <i>creeping darkness</i> spell, except the cloud is a cloud of shadow that deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage, is centered on you, and the damage dealt by the spell increases by 1d4 for each charge remaining in the book.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This small statuette of a snow-topped, forested mountain seems remarkably detailed, yet it stands only about 4 inches tall. Stories tell that it was a gift from the bearfolk to the shadow fey priests of Hecate when they first came to the Shadow Realm and that it was once merely a collapsible hill. Over time, its power has grown as it travels from one owner to another. The priests of Hecate say no one can retain it for more than a year.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you hold the <i>collapsible mountain</i>, you may take an action to speak its command word to instantaneously create a pine-covered mountain, fully 2,500 feet tall. You may choose to either have the mountain rise under you or to have the mountain rise under another creature you can see at least 120 feet away. In the first case, other creatures nearby may wind up hundreds of feet below you (and combat ends between any two non-adjacent creatures). Groups of creatures move roughly 2d6 Ã— 100 feet apart. If you have the mountain rise under another creature, you and adjacent creatures see the mountain grow rapidly nearby, but you remain at the altitude you started at. A small spring or brook usually appears nearby in this instance.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each day, the mountain's land and streams provide simple food and fresh, cold water sufficient to nourish 15 humanoids or five steeds.</p>
			<p class="indent">Speaking the command word again collapses the mountain. Any creature standing on it is not harmed (the descent is swift but not dangerous). Creatures who enter combat unaware of the nature of the <i>collapsible mountain</i> are treated as if surprised by the sudden change.</p>

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.</li>

				<li>As long as the helm has at least one black opal, you have resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
				<li>As long as the helm has at least one piece of obsidian, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to sizzle with black flames. The flames are harmless to you and to the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take necrotic damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits shadowy purple rays from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking necrotic damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hecate's lantern is said to have been used to divide darkness and light during the creation of the Shadow Realm. It is made of gold and mithral with panes of amber and clear crystal, and it can be held by an ornate loop at its top. A single ever-burning candle shines within, though the panes of the lantern often make it appear as three candles.</p>
			<p class="indent">You must be brandishing the lantern to use it. This lantern has 12 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d12 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the lantern's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the lantern vanishes and returns to a high priestess of Hecate or to the goddess herself.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Create Mire.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 5 charges to create shadow mire with a 40-foot radius centered on you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Force Shift.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend 3 charges to force any shapeshifter you can see within 120 feet to shift their form. If unwilling, the target gains a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> As an action, you can cast the <i>moonbeam</i> spell (2 charges) with a range encompassing any point you can see or the <i>child of light and darkness</i> spell (8 charges).</p>

			<p>This item resembles an ornate key of bright copper, often inset with semi-precious stones or detailed with engraved filigree scrollwork and ornaments. While holding the key, you can make a turning motion to create a door in any wall within 5 feet of you. This door goes through a wall up to 5 feet thick, creating an exit that remains until you remove it. Turning the key in the opposite direction turns any normal, nonâ€‘magical door into a section of stone or other material matching the wall to either side (wood, wattle, plaster, and so on).</p>

			<p>This gnarled willow root is worn and smooth. The wood is dark from long centuries spent absorbing the living darkness of the Shadow Realm.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you hold this rod in both hands by its short, forked branches, you feel it gently tugging you toward the closest source of fresh water. If the closest source of fresh water is located underground, the dowsing rod directs you to a spot above the source and then dips its tip down toward the ground. When you use this dowsing rod on the Material Plane, it directs you to bodies of water, such as creeks and ponds. When you use it in the Shadow Realm, where fresh water is much more difficult to find, it directs you to bodies of water, but it might also direct you toward homes with freshwater barrels or to creatures with containers of fresh water on them.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Used by the river giants to harvest memory fragments from the dark waters of the Shadow Realm, <i>mooncatcher's nets</i> are woven by the priests of Hecate or by moonshadow catcher goblins.</p>
			<p class="indent">You have a +1 bonus on attack rolls with this magic weapon. It has the normal effects of a net but is very tough. A creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength check to free itself or another creature from the net. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net also frees the creature. The net has AC 14 and 25 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the net drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">As well as using the net as a weapon, you can drag the net through dark water to harvest 1d4 random memory fragments. Roll 1d10 on the table below for each fragment to determine the memory fragment captured. Each memory fragment can be used as component in creating a memory philter of the type listed in parentheses. You must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to transfer each memory fragment from the net into a suitable container or it is lost.</p>

			<p>By speaking this weapon's command word as a bonus action, you activate a harsh purple light. While this light shines, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with beasts, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, and monstrosities.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, any foe or object you strike with a <i>scepter weapon</i> glows, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.</p>

			<p>You can use a bonus action to speak this magic scimitar's command word, causing golden radiance to spring from the blade.
