		<description>
			<p>When the elves first began to decline, some chose to stand their ground while others accepted a pact with the shadows. And then there were the sable elves who simply chose to run. Unfortunately, this splinter group of indecisive elves quickly made enemies, and they were scorned by the elves who had seized the opportunity to forge a shadow pact. So now, these sable elves are scattered about the realms in perpetual disgrace, not belonging anywhere. However, they have one redoubt of their own, the Court of Golden Oak.</p>
			<p class="indent">The few sable elves that remain possess the last vestiges of powerful elven magic that helped shape the early phases of the world, and they guard their secrets in isolation. Since there are so few of these elves remaining and only one community to speak of, the sable elf lineage is rapidly dying out. Their power allows these ancient elves to survive in almost any climate, and the dark forests of the Shadow Realm house a handful of these wanderers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sable elves are dark-eyed, often either red-haired or raven-haired, and silver-skinned. They have tall, willowy frames, similar to other elves. Most carry an irrepressible aura of world-weariness.</p>
			<h4>Sable Elf Names</h4>
			<p>Sable elves follow naming conventions of the ancient elves for their first birth name and their second adopted common name. However, they do not adopt the third name, or lineage name, that some elves do, as a reflection of their disgraced status.</p>
			<h4>Sable Elf Traits</h4>
			<p>You are an elf with a deeper affinity for elven magic that sets you apart from most other elves.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity decreases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Due to their exiled status, sable elves have lost attachment to many of the values traditionally held by elves. Centuries of solitude have pushed the remaining sable elves in different directions, and a variety of alignments are found within their ranks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blood Affinity.</em></strong> Choose a school of magic you have a natural affinity for. You learn a cantrip of your choice from that school. When you reach 3rd level, choose a 1st-level spell from the same school, and when you reach 5th level, choose a 3rd-level spell from the same school. You learn these spells and can cast them at their lowest level. Once you cast one of these spells, you must finish a long rest before you can cast the spell again using this feature. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is Intelligence.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and Umbral.</p>
