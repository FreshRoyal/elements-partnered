		<description>
			<p>All bearfolk share an inherent iron resolve, but none more so than those who call the Shadow Realm their home. The bearfolk who hail from the Moonlit Glades are hardened by a life of constant peril—the ever-present battle against shadow corruption. Only by banding together in tight-knit communities dedicated to fulfilling their noble purpose have the bearfolk miraculously continued to thrive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Since Mesikämmen the Bear King issued his fateful decree, the bearfolk have fought as a source of light in the Shadow Realm. While most of the region is deadly to even the most capable of travelers, the bearfolk have carved out pockets of safety guarded by druidic magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hard-won wisdom has taught the bearfolk the secrets of resisting and purifying shadow corruption. As their mission to drive back the darkness has grown over the centuries, generations of bearfolk have been born in the Shadow Realm. And the longer they stay, the more of each new generation shows an innate power to shape the darkness that surrounds them.</p>
			<h4>Bearfolk Names</h4>
			<p>Bearfolk are given cub names by their parents, and when they come of age, they earn a new name, either bestowed upon them by an elder or one they choose themselves. This name befits a deed undertaken during their rite of passage into adulthood, describes some honorable or prominent trait of the bearfolk in question, or honors an ancestor.</p>

			<p>The ekorre are the image most have in mind when discussing ratatosks. Superficially similar to squirrels, they have sleek fur, often in shades of red and brown, and tiny tusks. These celestials dwell upon Yggdrasil and all its branches. Clever, egotistical, and endlessly curious, the ekorre carry messages across the planes, sharing information from individual to individual in a never-ending gossip network.</p>
