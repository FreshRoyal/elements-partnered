		<description>
			<p>Shadow fey are the most abundant and established of the races who dwell in the Shadow Realm. They were long ago stolen away from the Bright Lands with promises of power. To outsiders, however, their origins are steeped in mystery. The shadow fey rule from their various courts fraught with intrigue and social maneuvering.</p>
			<p class="indent">Shadow fey are immune to the shadow corruption that threatens those from the mortal world, but this protection comes at a cost. Above all else, shadow fey want to experience the tantalizing emotions and passions that do not come easily to them. Plenty of courtly resources go toward the cultivation and trade of these emotions made tangible by fey magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Outside of the courts, shadow fey have built magnificent lantern-lit cities and fortresses that mark crossroads throughout the Shadow Realm. They have a deep knowledge of this dark land, and a long history with its powers, places, and secrets.</p>
			<p class="indent">A shadow fey character could easily be a minor noble from the courts of the shadow fey, from one of the handful of cities of the Shadow Realm, or from a remote outpost, where those deemed unfit for politics are trained to be scouts and hunters.</p>
			<p class="indent">Shadow fey resemble elves physically but with some striking differences. Their skin color tends toward alabaster white, ebon black, or subtle grays. Many have horns that range widely in size and shape.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>A Life at Court.</em></strong> The shadow fey are heavily concerned with courtly politics and often spend their lives positioning themselves to fall in the good graces of the lords and ladies who rule the realm. These fey are skilled manipulators and negotiators, raised from youth to be quick both with words and with the blade. Involvement in the eternal drama of the courts gives purpose to their long lives. Still, their constant desire for novelty can easily see them indulge in long periods of travel or other worthwhile pursuits.</p>
			<h4>Shadow Fey Names</h4>
			<p>Naming conventions among the shadow fey are similar to those favored by elves, but their imagery is darker and more guarded. They favor themes of gloom and seclusion over sunshine and tinkling brooks.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Example Male Names:</strong> Drilfind, Edgwin, Ethdrin, Lorinidral, Quentor, Shanles, Thanascil, Torvobar, Varratir, Vashrin.</li>
				<li><strong>Example Female Names:</strong> Anorla, Bornva, Dulira, Fanwi, Girethdra, Lanrama, Methada, Phorla, Suzenga, Thortha.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Shadow Fey Traits</h4>
			<p>Shadow fey are a subrace of elf. They enjoy the base elven racial traits, along with the following subrace traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Although they have a malevolent reputation, the shadow fey are not inherently evil. They tend toward chaotic neutral, though every variation exists.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shadow Fey Weapon Training.</em></strong> You have proficiency with the rapier, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Path of Shadows.</em></strong> When in darkness, dim light, or a shadow large enough to cover your body, you can cast the <i>misty step</i> spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in bright sunlight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Traveler in Darkness.</em></strong> You have advantage on any Intelligence (Arcana) check to learn about a particular shadow road and how it functions.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and Umbral.</p>
