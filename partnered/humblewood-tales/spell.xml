		<description>
			<p>Drawing on primordial magic, you instill vitality in nearby plants to create one of the following effects within range:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You instantly repair a single break or tear in a living plant you touch, such as torn foliage, a scorched branch, a scar cut into bark, or two pieces of a plant that have been broken apart. As long as the damage is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former destruction.</li>
				<li>You instantly cause a defoliated plant to grow foliage, cause a planted seed to sprout, or restore the ability to sprout to a dead seed pod.</li>
				<li>You can cause a 5-foot cube of living plants to flourish with foliage such as leaves and grass. This area can become thick enough to conceal a Medium or smaller creature, or become overgrown enough to become difficult terrain (your choice when you cast the spell).</li>
				<li>You can touch a living plant or plant creature to grant it 1d4 temporary hit points.</li>
			</ul>
