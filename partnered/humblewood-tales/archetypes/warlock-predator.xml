		<description>
			<p>Your patron is a primal beast, driven by a bloodthirsty need to hunt. These beings tempt creatures to give in to their base instincts and become apex predators. Ancient white dragons, demons with a bestial bent, and the Amaranthine Kren have all been known to occasionally grant feral powers to those desperate enough to seek their aid. Many who strike a pact with a Predator find themselves forever changed, bearing razor teeth and wicked claws, an aspect of their predatory patron.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 1st level, you can use your bonus action to channel the ferocity and guile of your patron, transforming into a beastly figure. For 10 minutes, you gain the following abilities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are flooded with adrenaline, feeling nothing besides the thrill of the hunt. You gain temporary hit points equal to two times your warlock level, up to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points at 10th level. These temporary hit points last until the end of your transformation.</li>
				<li>Your senses become supernaturally keen. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth), Wisdom (Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks you make to track or stalk your prey.</li>
				<li>You sprout a set of pointed teeth and razor-sharp claws, which are natural weapons you can use to make unarmed strikes against creatures within 5 feet of you. You have proficiency with these weapons and can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls made using these natural weapons. On a hit, your bite deals 1d6 piercing damage, and your claws deal 1d4 slashing damage. If you already had a bite or claw attack (talon attacks count as claw attacks), its damage increases by one step (a d4 becomes a d6, a d6 becomes a d8, etc.). As a bonus action, after making a bite attack, you can make a claw attack.</li>
				<li>Starting at 5th level, your muscles strengthen, and your movements quicken. You can now make two claw attacks using your bonus action after you have made a bite attack with your action. Additionally, at 5th level, you can take the Dash or Hide action as a bonus action while you are in your Form of the Beast.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">You can use this feature twice per short or long rest. At 6th level, your transformation lasts for 1 hour instead of 10 minutes.</p>

			<p>At 10th level, you learn how to channel the presence of a frightful beast, even when not transformed. You can use your action to cause each hostile creature you can see within a 30-foot radius to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute, and it is restrained until the end of your next turn. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
