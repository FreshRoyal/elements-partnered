			<p>For millennia, the tarandus have been known as a society of explorers devoted to charting and understanding the world. Their culture prizes discovery, and they believe that their lives are best spent travelling, observing and creating maps that guide others along safe paths.</p>
			<p class="indent">All tarandus possess antlers that rise roughly a foot above their heads. Their dark-red noses can emit a gentle glow, often used for reading maps in dim light or signalling danger to their allies. Tarandus fur ranges from deep brown to pure white, shifting with age, climate or diet. They usually wear simple outfits, though more ornate garments and armour may be loaned to individuals by their herd in honour of taking on a specific role or responsibility.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their settlements are filled with map-halls and navigation schools, where trained explorers record the land, stars and seas with care. Some tarandus dedicate their lives to perfecting the art of map making, while others roam the world as scouts, guides or couriers, ensuring that their knowledge of routes and geography remains current.</p>
			<p class="indent">Tarandus herds are large and communal, sharing duties such as child-rearing and foraging. They maintain strong ties between herds through regular gatherings where new maps and discoveries are exchanged. As most tarandus are used to the safety and rhythm of herd life, those who travel alone often join adventuring groups as temporary companions.</p>
