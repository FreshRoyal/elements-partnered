		<description>
			<p>Hederans are living embodiments of alpine trees, sentient beings of bark and leaf whose bodies host moss, holly and fungi. Their outer skin is made of thick bark that toughens with age, and beneath lies a network of green, sap-filled muscle. Twigs and berries sprout unpredictably, with the brightest clusters gathered around their heads. Their leaves and bark vary in colour, and are as diverse as the lands they live in.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hederans have extraordinary lifespans, with some reaching over a thousand years of age. Every two centuries or so, a hederan enters a rare blooming phase when the flowers on its body release pollen and a single silver seed forms upon its back. The seed must be planted within a week, or it will wither away, but from it a new hederan sapling will grow.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once planted by their parent, a hederan forms a deep bond with the soil of its homeland. They serve as guardians of winter forests, and maintain the balance of nature. Solitary by nature, they can live for centuries without meeting another of their kind, and no one knows how many exist across the world.</p>
