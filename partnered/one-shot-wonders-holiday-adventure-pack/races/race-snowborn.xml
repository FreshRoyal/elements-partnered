		<description>
			<p>The snowborn are a young species, and have existed for less than fifty years. They first appeared during a notably long and cold winter, which snowborn commonly refer to as 'The First Flurry'. Beyond that, little is known about their creation, though elemental magic was clearly involved. New snowborn have appeared and vanished over the years since their origin, yet the pattern of their life and rebirth remains a mystery even to them. Each fleeting snowborn lives for up to 20 years.</p>
			<p class="indent">A snowborn's body is formed of compacted snow. They have a small sphere for a head, branch-like limbs, and they can harden into ice to protect themselves. Despite their coal eyes and carrot noses, they perceive the world as keenly as any other species. Snowborn enjoy using clothing as self-expression, like a jaunty hat or colourful scarf.</p>
			<h5>Snowborn TRAITS</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled" style="text-indent:-1em; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:5px">
				<li><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Construct</li>
				<li><strong>Size:</strong> Small (about 2–4 ft tall) or Medium (about 4–7 ft tall), chosen when you select this species</li>
				<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a Snowborn, you have these special traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Chilled Anatomy.</em></strong> You have Resistance to Cold damage. You also know the <i>Ray of Frost</i> cantrip.</p> 
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Compacted Snow.</em></strong> You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you, but you can't stop in the same space. Additionally, you can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than you without movement penalties.</p> 
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Frigid Construct.</em></strong> You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a Long Rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours unmoving; during this time you are indistinguishable from a snowman, but retain consciousness. You don't need to eat, drink or breathe.</p> 
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Glacial Form.</em></strong> Once per long rest, you can cast the <i>False Life</i> spell without using the material components or expending a spell slot, and harden your body into ice.</p>
