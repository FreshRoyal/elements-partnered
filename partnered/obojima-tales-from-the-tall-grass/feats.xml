			<p>You have a peculiar way of fumbling through life that somehow always works out in your favor, succeeding in situations through what others might view as accidental luck. When you fail an ability check and roll a number on the die equal to half your level (rounded up) or lower, you can choose to replace the die roll with a 15 instead. You can use this ability three times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack. Once you assume this stance, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>

When you cast a spell that forces a target to make a saving throw or requires you to make a spell attack roll, you can choose to enhance the spell through song. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use this, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you do so, make a Charisma (Performance) check. The DC for this check is equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a success, your proficiency bonus is doubled for the spell attack roll or your save DC for that casting of the spell.</p>
