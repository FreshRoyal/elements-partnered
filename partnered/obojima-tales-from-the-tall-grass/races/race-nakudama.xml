			<p>A sweet treat left untasted, a hot spring left undipped in, a warm fire left unsharedâ€”all considered tragedies by a people driven to indulge in all the comforts and curiosities Obojima has to offer. To the other peoples of the island, the amphibious Nakudama seem to partake in all things with a sense of eagerness and excitement.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nakudama tend to eschew enclaves for the more cosmopolitan settlements scattered across the island. They are highly social. Patrons of tea houses, taverns, and inns are sure to hear the booming, croaking voices of Nakudama mingling with crowds.</p>
			<h4>Did I Ever Tell You the Story About...</h4>
			<p>Life is too short to spend time on anything not worth recounting in an over-the-top tale later. Sharing and collecting stories is among the most cherished Nakudama traditions. It's what motivates many Nakudama to travel the island or frequent social gatherings. A quality story doesn't just happen, however. Any Nakudama will tell you it's one part lived experience and two parts showmanship, which includes creative license and allows for at least a bit of exaggeration. The art can be practiced, but experience must be earned. Therefore, Nakudama tend to venture out regularly in search of novel stories to share.</p>
			<h4>Obojima's Earliest Inhabitants (Perhaps)</h4>
			<p>Though the details have been lost to history or exaggerated over years of storytelling, it is generally believed that the Nakudama were the first people to call Obojima home. Several sites around the island point to an ancient Nakudama civilization, and many settlements appear to incorporate Nakudama architecture, which is noteworthy for its water features.</p>
			<p class="indent">Other evidence that suggests an earlier Nakudama Age comes from the tales, which are filled with the fantastical feats of a powerful Nakudama queen. Though often overly dramatic in the portrayals, her exploits seem to line up with recent archaeological findings.</p>
