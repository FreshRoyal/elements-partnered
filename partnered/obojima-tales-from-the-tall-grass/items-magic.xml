At the top of the tendrils are the smushed faces of 3 elderly men, all of which quickly begin to bicker amongst themselves. You can ask each man one question, and he will answer to the best of his ability. Once you have asked them all a question, they begin to ignore you and continue to argue amongst themselves until the lid is replaced at the top of the pot.</p>
			<p class="indent">It's unknown who these men were, but each seems to retain knowledge from their past lives. Once you ask one of the men a question, you can't ask him another question until 7 days have passed.</p>

			<p class="indent">Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, after which point you must spend 1 hour performing a revitalizing ritual on the pendant for it to regain the use of this property. The ritual consumes three common potion ingredients.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As an action, <i>Oiki's Pinwheel</i> can be spun and placed on the ground. Each hostile creature within 120 feet of the pinwheel that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the pinwheel stops spinning. The pinwheel spins for 1 minute, or it spins indefinitely as long as it is within a strong wind. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the ends of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once <i>Oiki's Pinwheel</i> stops spinning, its magic transfers to another random pinwheel on the same plane of existence.</p>

			<p>This stylish jacket has illusionary magic sewn into its seams. While wearing the jacket, you can use an action to take on an illusory disguise chosen by the jacket's enchanter. The jacket makes you—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look like the humanoid chosen when the jacket was enchanted.</p>
			<p class="indent">To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This well-made hat can come in any shape, size, or form and from casual inspection seems to be mundane in nature. However, when the hat is placed on the ground as an action and its command word is spoken, it begins to float into the air. The hovering hat then produces an illusion of a humanoid of your choice that you are familiar with, with the caveat that the illusion is wearing the hat. The figure can't move and fails to hold up to physical inspection. The illusion remains until the hat is moved out of place, or until the command word is spoken once more, causing the hat to float back to the ground. A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the figure is an illusion.</p>

If the spirit has a challenge rating of 3 or higher, it automatically succeeds on the save.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the spirit is sealed inside, it is in a state of slumber. It doesn't need to eat or breathe, it doesn't suffer from any wounds or illnesses, and it ceases to age.

When you do so, the lantern moves up to 20 feet in a direction of your choice. It deactivates if it is ever more than 500 feet away from you. The lantern can move through water and across any solid surface (including up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings). If you command the lantern to follow you, it will always remain within 10 feet of you, provided no obstacles impede its path.</p>
