			<p>The ways of witchery are mysterious and often guarded by its practitioners. Whether you sought it out or a witch recognized something in you, you came to apprentice for a witch or coven. Under their tutelage, you were introduced to Obojima's folk magic tradition, where you learned the rudiments of potions and other magical preparations. Although you may have trained under one for some time, you never officially joined one of the covens and are considered a witch without a crest. For more on witch covens, see page 19.</p>
