			<p>Though everyone living on Obojima comes in contact with spirits to one degree or another, your interaction with the Spirit Realm has always occurred with peculiar regularity. All your life you've had a special kinship with spirits that few share in. You've come to love their food, their culture, and their people more than the average material being. These habits have drawn fascination, suspicion, and confusion from locals, but that doesn't stop them from enlisting your talents when spirit stuff gets weird.</p>

				<li> <strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Mechanics, Persuasion</li>
				<li> <strong>Languages:</strong> Torum</li>
				<li> <strong>Equipment:</strong> A bedroll, 10 candles, two different common ingredients (linked to your spirit allies), a special item gifted to you by a spirit, and 10 gold flowers.</li>

			<p>You have come to know two spirits by name, and through your relationship have learned special rituals and techniques that allow you to find them across the Physical and Spirit Realms.</p>
			<p class="indent">By using two unique ingredients that you choose when taking this background, you can contact these spirits from any distance or plane of existence. The ritual you enact to utilize these ingredients and contact a spirit is uniquely your ownâ€”it might involve a tea ceremony, or perhaps the burning of the ingredients and partaking in the aromatic smoke they produce.</p>
