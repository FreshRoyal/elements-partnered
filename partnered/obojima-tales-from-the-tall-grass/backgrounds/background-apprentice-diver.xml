			<p>You are or once were a member of the Mariners' Guild, an intrepid group of aquatic explorers and mariners. Working as an apprentice diver in the lodge you have learned much about the Shallowsâ€”you know what is dangerous and what is delicious. You have climbed the cliffs around the island, explored many beaches, and learned how to use the gear needed to survive under the waves. For more on the Mariners' Guild, see page 17.</p>
