		<description>
			<p>When consumed, this unassuming elixir magically transforms your head into a random anthropomorphic animal, such as a horse, panda, pig, or raccoon. This effect lasts until removed, as if it were a curse. This doesn't count against the number of potions you can have affecting your body at once.</p>

			<p>Drinking this fuzzy liquid gives the sensation of wool rubbing against your entire body. When consumed, you instantly grow facial hair, even if you would not normally be able to do so. The style of facial hair is random, and it stays on your face until shaven off. This doesn't count against the number of potions you can have affecting your body at once.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This potion was discovered by accident by the great brewmaster, Bowark. Unsealing it fills the room with a strong scent of hops and yeasty goodness. When consumed, this beer gives you a warm, euphoric calm that makes you feel like everything will be alright. Until this potion's effects end, you can choose to reroll any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you make. You can reroll in this way a total of 7 times before the potion wears off.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The brewer of this potion rolls a d4 to determine the number of servings it creates. When poured out, this liquid quickly forms into an appetizing breakfast, such as some bread or pancakes. A creature that consumes a serving of it feels satiated for the day, and its exhaustion level is reduced by 1. It takes 1 minute to consume one serving, and once a creature benefits from this effect, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest. The food spoils after 24 hours, losing its magic.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As part of the bonus action to consume this potion, you speak a message and hiccup a bubble, which magically contains the message inside it. You then describe a creature you are familiar with and the bubble floats to that creature, traveling at a speed of 1 mile per hour, and then pops. The bubble pops early if it takes any damage. When the bubble pops, it releases the contained message in your voice.</p>

Additionally, you can take an action to cause the flame on your head to flare up and burst outward, dealing 2d4 fire damage to all other creatures within 5 feet of you; using this ability causes the effects of this potion to end early.</p>

While the potion is active, you gain the ability to purr like a cat.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you drink this potion, your hair turns dark red (if you have any), and you gain the ability to speak with chickens permanently, as if by the <i>Speak with Animals</i> spell. Additionally, you can crow a sacred and thunderous cackle that summons 100 chickens in a 20-foot radius centered on you. These chickens appear running from a distance, digging out from the ground below, and falling from the sky in a veritable tsunami of flapping, clucking poultry. Each creature in the area (excluding you) must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 30d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you've summoned the chickens in this way, you can't do so again. This doesn't count against the number of potions you can have affecting your body at once.</p>

The first nonmagical object submerged in the water for at least 1 minute gains a permanent magical effect. This effect is random and powerful enough that the item's rarity should be considered uncommon or higher.</p>

		<description>
			<p>After drinking this potion, you no longer walk or run—now you dance. Going from one place to another is no longer a mundane trudge, a shuffling expression of ennui. How you get from point A to point B is now a dazzling dance performance. From smooth, elven waltzes, to Nakudama hops and gyrations, to the interpretive dance forms of the dara, you explore them all. Your stylish moves increase your walking speed by 10 feet, give you a +5 bonus to Charisma (Performance) checks that involve dancing, and grant you proficiency in Dexterity saving throws if you don't already have it. This lasts until you dismiss the potion's effects as an action.</p>

			<p>You can coat one melee weapon with this potion. When you hit a creature with the coated weapon in the next hour, you can force it to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the weapon is no longer coated in the potion, and the target begins to convulse in a manner that could be mistaken for an awkward, clumsy series of dance steps. The target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn, after which the convulsing ends.</p>

For 1 minute, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Until the potion's effects end, your creature type changes to Demon (Fiend).</p>

Anyone who can see you when the hands first emerge must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of your next turn; creatures that are friendly to you have advantage on this save. Additionally, the arms lash out from you, clawing at all other creatures within 20 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d6 necrotic damage and can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage but suffers no other effect.</p>

			<p>When imbibed, this acrid elixir loosens your soul from your body and prepares it for transfer. The first time you are touched by a creature after consuming this potion, your mind and soul transfer into that creature's body. While inhabiting the creature's body, you can force it to make a contested Intelligence or Wisdom check (you both choose which ability to use) at the start of each of its turns. If you succeed, you gain total control over the creature until the start of its next turn. While your mind and soul are away, your body is left unconscious. If the creature dies while your mind and soul are still inside it, you also die. You inhabit the creature's body for 1 hour, until you dismiss the effect as an action, or until the creature is targeted by a <i>Dispel Evil and Good</i> spell.</p>

Until this effect ends, you can choose to project your thoughts into the bubble, where they manifest as illusory but silent words or images (your choice), which anyone can see.</p>

			<p>When consumed, this warming harvest beverage transforms your head into a Jack-O'-Lantern. From your newly formed eyes, you cast a cone of glowing light, which causes creatures in a 15-foot cone to be under the effects of the <i>Faerie Fire</i> spell. At the start of each of your turns while the effects last, you decide which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The effect of the potion lasts for 1 minute.</p>

			<p>When you drink this potion, your skin begins to shed dim light in a 10-foot radius around you. As a bonus action, you can choose to intensify this light—shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 10 feet—or diminish the intensity again. Additionally, you can take an action to produce a flare of blinding light around you. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can see must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effects of this potion last for 8 hours or until you use the flare.</p>

Otherwise, the clone uses all of your statistics, except that it is a construct. The clone lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.</p>

The clone lasts until you dismiss it or it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it disappears in a cloud of butterflies. When it disappears, your mind returns to your original body.</p>

			<p>Drinking this pink, bitter-tasting potion, causes hundreds of small, iridescent bubbles to emerge from your nose and mouth and fill a 20-foot cube that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the bubbles are left untouched, they float in place, remaining there for 1 hour. When a creature enters a space occupied by the bubbles for the first time on a turn, it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a cacophony of popping erupts as the bubbles burst, dealing 1d6 thunder damage to all creatures inside the cube. The sound of the bubbles popping can be heard from a mile away.</p>

			<p>When you drink this potion, you feel a slight pressure behind your eyes as though something is pushing on the inside of your skull trying to get out. For the next minute, you gain the ability to move an inanimate object within 60 feet of you with your mind. The object can be no larger than 5 inches in diameter and weigh no more than 1 pound, and it can't be worn or carried. Moving an object in this way requires an action. You can move the object up to 30 feet in any direction, and you can't move it more than 60 feet away from you.</p>

			<p>Drinking this potion causes you to hyperfixate on your strikes but potentially opens you to counterattacks. The effects of this potion last for 1 minute. For the duration, the first time you hit a target with a weapon attack on each of your turns, it deals an extra 1d12 damage of the same type. Until the potion's effects end, you also take a -2 penalty to AC.</p>

			<p>This potion must be shared with another creature, each of them ingesting half of the potion. When the second half of the potion is consumed, the first creature gains the ability to see through the eyes of the second creature, gaining the benefits of any special senses that creature has. While seeing in this way, the first creature is blind with regard to its own senses. Either creature can use its action to stop shared vision or reactivate it. This ability lasts for 8 hours, and it can't be used if the creatures are more than 1 mile apart.</p>

For the next hour, when you cast a spell that produces or manipulates water in some capacity, the spell is cast as if using a spell slot of one level higher. Additionally, spells that use water to deal damage to a creature or object deal an extra 2d12 bludgeoning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can throw the potion into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, breaking the glass and summoning three water elementals in the nearest unoccupied spaces. These creatures are under your control until destroyed.</p>
