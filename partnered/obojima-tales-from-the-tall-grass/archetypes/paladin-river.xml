		<description>
			<p>Those who commit themselves to the Oath of the River have found guidance in the shifting waters and the great creatures that live within them. These diverse individuals model their lives and the tenets they follow after the tranquil waters of a blue pool and the rushing rapids that spill over a great waterfall, always striving to flow around obstacles if possible, but ready to crash through them when left with no other option. As the river flows and bends, it seeks the path of least resistance in its travels to the ocean. Like the river, paladins who have sworn this oath remain adaptable but steadfast in their own course.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Tenets of the River</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of The River vary by paladin, but all of them revolve around embracing the flow and adaptability found in water. Paladins who uphold these tenets must understand when it is best to dispatch justice through violence or through understanding and forgiveness. The core principles of the tenets are:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The River Flows On.</em></strong> Forgiveness can be as sharp as any blade.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The River Quenches or Drowns.</em></strong> Judgment is reserved for those truly deserving of it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The River Rages.</em></strong> If I must battle, I will fight with all my passion and strength.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The River Seeks the Sea...Always.</em></strong> I will not abandon my duty, especially when others are counting on me.</p>
