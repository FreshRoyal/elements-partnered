			<p>Spirits on Obojima are magical entities that come in all kinds of shapes and sizes and have lived among the islanders for centuries. Spirits are as much a part of Obojiman society as all the other races, and it has been this way for as long as anyone can remember.</p>
			<h4>Spirit Creature Types</h4>
			<p class="indent">In the world of Obojima, there are no other planes of existence other than the Spirit Realm and the Physical Realm, and because of that, extraplanar creatures such as Fey, Celestials, and Aberrations instead become the creature type "spirit". That also means that spells and other special abilities that would affect those creature types affect the "spirit" creature type instead.</p>
