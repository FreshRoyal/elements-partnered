		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The blood-knights of Hell, Sanguine Knights serve Sutekh, Lord of Blood. Their sorceries drain their enemies' life force, pouring this stolen vitality into infernal rituals to turn the tide of battle.</p>
			<p>Sutekh rules Naraka, the City of Blood. Recognized as the greatest sorcerer in hell, he carries the title of High Sanguinary and rules from the Temple of Vitality. He is a master of blood magic, and his inner circle of priests and wizards are the Bloodliches, undead spellcasters whose corporeal forms turned to ash centuries ago and whose bodies are crafted from solid blood.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sutekh's illriggers all belong to a cult known as the Chalice of Vitality. Knights of the Chalice drink deeply of their enemies' essence, draining it to power their magics. Other members of the Order of Desecration fear that the Sanguine Knights seek more than Sutekh's mere ascension to the Throne of Hell; some whisper that the Chalice secretly schemes to make Sutekh a god. This would, of course, be treason.</p>

				<h5>CONTENT WARNING</h5>
				<p>This subclass deals with manipulating another creature's blood. Before choosing this subclass, please ensure everyone at your table is comfortable with this concept. And as always, we encourage the ongoing use of safety tools throughout your game.</p>
			</div>
			<h5 class="caption">Precepts of Blood</h5>
			<p>Sanguine Knights swear an oath to Sutekh when they join the Order of Desolation. These tenets swear them to wield profane blood magic, commanding loyalty and inflicting terror.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Their Strength is Their Weakness.</em></strong> I target the strongest of my foes, for their vitality shall feed my victory.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sin Demands Suffering.</em></strong> Opposing me is heresy. Before my enemies taste defeat, they must pay for their unbelief with agony.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Loyalty Rewarded.</em></strong> My boons lead my allies to depend on meâ€”and on the bloodshed that empowers me.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mercy is Power.</em></strong> In granting succor to my allies, I prove how great my power is. Each time I restore life, it serves as a reminder of how quickly I can strip it away.</p>

			<p><em>3rd-Level Sanguine Knight Feature</em></p>
			<p>When Sutekh accepts you as his illrigger, he grants you access to his sacrilegious command of blood and life. You gain proficiency in the Religion skill.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, as an action, you can expand your awareness of life around you. Until the end of your next turn, you can sense creatures who have blood within 120 feet of you without having to see them. This ability can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. You know the distance and direction of each creature, as well as the creature's type. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

Another creature you can see within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer that same condition until the end of your next turn. If that creature is immune to the condition, they don't suffer the condition, but the condition ends for the original creature.</p>
