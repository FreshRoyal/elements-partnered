			<description>When an interdicted creature you can see within 60 ft of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to burn one or more of the seals on them. When you do, burning the seal deals no damage, and instead you cast counterspell on them without expending a spell slot. Your spell's level increases by 1 for every additional seal you burn after the first.</description>
