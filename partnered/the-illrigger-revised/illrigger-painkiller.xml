		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The heavily armored death troopers of Hell, Painkillers serve Dispater, leading from the front of every major infernal battle.</p>
			<p>Dispater rules Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater's army does the fighting and dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. The imperious Painkillers are full of pride and hubris, and they often obsess over their personal appearance.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, a Painkiller's gallantry is twisted. They accept and honor challenges to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfereâ€”but if losing, they don't hesitate to cheat, and if winning, they arrogantly toy with an enemy before finishing them.</p>
			<p class="indent">In a moment of weakness or desperation, a ruler in another world might see their army facing certain defeat and call on Dispater. Ever eager to sow strife and discord, Dispater often responds to these pleas by sending a Painkiller to lead the desperate ruler's armies.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Precepts of Pride</h5>
			<p>Dispater's heavy shock troops must be effective battlefield commanders and quickly dispatch enemies. Painkillers follow precepts instructing them to lead Hell's armies and wage war against Good across the timescape.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Lead from the Front.</em></strong> I charge in at the front of every battle, inspiring my soldiers and terrifying my enemies.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Commander.</em></strong> Wherever I go, I command. I don't take orders from those who don't have the will to lead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Victory at Any Cost.</em></strong> I respect the enemy leader and treat them honorably. But once swords are drawn, I use every trick in my arsenal to win, expecting them to do the same.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Soldiers Die.</em></strong> I care not for the lives of my soldiers, for they are resources I spend to secure my victory.</p>
