	<element name="Bloodsbane" type="Magic Item" source="The Illrigger Revised" id="ID_MCDM_ILLR_MAGIC_ITEM_BLOODSBANE">		
		<description>
			<p>This oil is deceptively clear and smells faintly like parchment, dried ink, and a touch of sulfur. To unlock the oil's power, an additional component must be mixed in (as shown in the Bloodsbane Effects table); this component may have already been added, or the oil's user can acquire an unmixed oil and add the component as part of a short or long rest. These components are difficult to sense once diluted in the oil, and identifying this oil may require a keen nose or additional research.</p>
			<p class="indent">The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil in this way takes 1 minute, during which time a willing creature must offer one drop of their blood, mixing it into the oil to activate its magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature hit with a weapon or ammunition coated in this oil must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer an effect depending on the oil's special component added. In addition, if the creature fails the saving throw and the blood in the oil came from an illrigger, the creature has a seal placed on them by that illrigger. This seal doesn't count against the number of seals granted by the illrigger's Baleful Interdict feature.</p>

			<p>This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your <i>true name</i> to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.</p>
			<p class="indent">The typical <i>True Name</i>, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.</p>
