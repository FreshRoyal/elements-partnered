		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Architects of Ruin are cool and calculating arcane knights who serve Asmodeus, deploying spells, steel, and subterfuge to win at any cost.</p>
			<p>Asmodeus rules Acheron, the City of Fear. His illriggers scour the timescape, collecting secrets and spells designed to deceive and terrify his opponents. The war he fights against the other archdevils is one of deception and information.</p>
			<p class="indent">His Architects of Ruin work to make Hell's enemies seem outnumbered and outmaneuvered. These illriggers are skillful spellblades on the battlefield, though some employ tactics such as research, infiltration, and propaganda to play mind games with their quarry. When an Architect of Ruin finally confronts an enemy, the advantage is theirs—they have studied, prepared, and gripped fate within their gauntlet, forcing it to favor them. They hungrily seek the dark arts to arm both themselves and Asmodeus with the impossible.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Precepts of Ruin</h5>
			<p>Architects of Ruin swear an oath to Asmodeus when they join the Order of Desolation. These precepts commit them to destroy Asmodeus's enemies by commanding great magic, causing fear, and sowing distrust.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Battlefield of the Mind.</em></strong> By the time my armies meet yours, you'll be filled with terror and doubt your own strength. I won't have to lift a finger to defeat you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Proper Secret.</em></strong> Once I know your secrets, I know your weakness.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Knowledge Is Power.</em></strong> Lore is as powerful as steel. I learn every detail about my enemy and anticipate their every move, checkmating them before the game even begins.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Magic Is Mine to Command.</em></strong> Cunning is also as powerful as steel. I wield the dark arcane arts to manipulate your senses, weaken your resolve, and strengthen my blade. Your soldiers will quake for fear of what dark magics may next cloak my blade.</p>

			<p>As an Architect of Ruin, you access a well of profane magic to cast spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You know two cantrips of your choice from the Architect of Ruin spell list (presented at the end of this subclass). You learn an additional cantrip from this list at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Architect of Ruin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your illrigger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell hellish rebuke and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast hellish rebuke using either slot.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> At 3rd level, you know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Architect of Ruin spell list (presented at the end of this subclass).</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Architect of Ruin Spellcasting table shows when you learn more illrigger spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the illrigger spells you know with another spell of your choice from the illrigger spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Focus.</em></strong> You have an unholy symbol, such as an amulet symbolizing your archdevil, a fragment of a blasphemous relic, or a glass orb holding a consecrated drop of archdevil blood. You can use the unholy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your illrigger spells. You must have a free hand to use the unholy symbol, but it can be the same hand you use to perform somatic components.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Axiomatic Seals (7th Level).</i></b> Asmodeus's secrets allow you to infuse your seals with manifest power.

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellbreaker (13th Level).</i></b> When an interdicted creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to burn one or more of the seals on them. When you do, burning the seal deals no damage, and instead you cast counterspell on them without expending a spell slot. Your spell's level increases by 1 for every additional seal you burn after the first.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hell Mage (18th Level; Passive).</i></b> When you or an ally within 30 feet of you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect imposed by an enemy, you can immediately place one or more seals on that enemy, up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
