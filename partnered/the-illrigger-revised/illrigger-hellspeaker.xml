		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The charismatic and manipulative Hellspeakers serve Moloch as they slip about the battlefield, coercing enemies into becoming unwitting allies.</p>
			<p>Moloch rules Styx, the City of Lies, but his reach extends far beyond it. Hell's greatest politicians and diplomats rise to prominence through Moloch's subtle manipulations. They follow him with great loyalty, for they know they are nothing without himâ€”and thus his power echoes through all of Hell.</p>
			<p class="indent">Moloch's illriggers are silver-tongued enchanters, lulling his foes to complacency with sorcery and subterfuge until they wake and find themselves under the command of the Order of Desolation. These Hellspeakers train in the art known as the Red Cant or Hell's Cant. By understanding their enemy and through weaving subtle sorceries into normal speech, Hellspeakers can make their foes feel, think, or do nearly anything to accelerate Hell's victory.</p>
			<p class="indent">Across the timescape, Hellspeakers enjoy a reputation as smiling rogues and swashbuckling villains. An asset in any negotiation, Hellspeakers know that in a world of lies, the truth can be as potent a weapon as steel.</p>

				<h5>CONTENT WARNING</h5>
				<p>This subclass has themes of mental manipulation and mind control. Before choosing this subclass, please ensure everyone at the table is comfortable exploring these dark and harmful themes. And as always, we encourage the ongoing use of safety tools throughout your game.</p>
			</div>
			<h5 class="caption">Precepts of Deception</h5>
			<p>Hellspeakers swear an oath to Moloch when they join the Order of Desolation. By following these precepts, they infiltrate the farthest reaches of power and manipulate all under their influence.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>My Voice Is a Weapon.</em></strong> Even when my enchantments fail, if my enemy can hear me, they are mine.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Doubt Is Certainty.</em></strong> I need not convince my enemy, only sow doubt and wait for it to bear fruit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Trust Me.</em></strong> For each lie I utter, I tell the truth tenfold. One who always lies says nothing.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Never Tell the Same Lie Twice.</em></strong> An overused skill becomes too predictable. Keep moving, switch targets, keep them guessing.</p>

			<p><em>3rd-Level Hellspeaker Feature</em></p>
			<p>When Moloch accepts you as his illrigger, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion or Deception skill (your choice). If you already have proficiency in the skill of your choice, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with that skill.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, your Forked Tongue feature grants you an additional language (for a total of three at 3rd level and four at 9th level). Whenever you speak in a language gained by this feature, your devilish influence is subconsciously felt by creatures who can hear and understand you, granting you advantage on Charisma checks to influence those creatures.</p>

			<p>You can whisper to the legions of Hell, ensnaring enemies and calling allies. As an action, you can attempt to banish a creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
