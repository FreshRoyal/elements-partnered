			<p>Your fate-touched essence can cause events to shift in your favor. When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can choose to reroll the d20. You must reroll the die before the outcome of the initial roll is determined.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, when a creature you can see makes an attack against you or makes a saving throw against one of your spells or features, you can force that creature to reroll the attack roll or saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the roll that triggers the reroll is made with advantage or disadvantage, both d20s are rerolled. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

	<element name="Cataclysm Bolts" type="Magic Item" source="Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn" id="ID_CRDP_TCSR_MAGIC_ITEM_CATACLYSM_BOLTS">
		<description>
			<p>These steel crossbow bolts were first created by the Jaggenstrike Clan during the Scattered War, and the secret to crafting them remains well guarded by the Houses of Kraghammer. Cataclysm bolts are usually kept in sets of ten, though anyone who holds even one can feel it thrumming with magical power. When you hit with an attack using a cataclysm bolt, the attack deals normal damage. Then roll a d6 on the following table to determine its additional effect.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td>1-2</td><td>The bolt explodes in a blast of fire, dealing 3d8 fire damage to the target and each creature within 5 feet of it.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>3-4</td><td>The bolt freezes the air around the target into jagged ice. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage and be restrained until the end of your next turn.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>5</td><td>The bolt releases a pulse of necrotic energy. The target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</td></tr>
					<tr><td>6</td><td>The bolt shatters to unleash a burst of shrapnel. Make six additional ranged attacks against the target, each of which has a +7 attack bonus and deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.</td></tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="indent">Once the bolt hits, the enchantment ends and it becomes a normal piece of ammunition.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This exquisite brocade coat is cut in a long, high-collared style popular among nobles of the Clovis Concordâ€”a nation on the west coast of Wildemount whose stylish fashion is often mimicked in Tal'Dorei. Its shimmering lining hints at its magical properties. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this coat, which can be worn over light armor.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, the coat has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you are the target of an attack while wearing this coat, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to gain resistance to one type of damage from the triggering attack. This resistance is effective against the triggering attack and lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This dark metal blade bends in a wicked, hooked curve. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can spend 1 Hit Die to deal an extra 3d6 necrotic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the weapon or you attune to it. Attuning to the dagger curses you until you are targeted by the <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar magic; disposing of the dagger fails to end the curse. While cursed, whenever you receive magical healing, you must spend 1 Hit Die to regain any hit points. If you spend all your Hit Dice at any point, you die.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This silver stiletto blade bears intricate grooves that spiral from its tip to its ivory hilt and handle. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can place the point of the blade into any keyhole and seal it shut. A keyhole sealed in this way can't be unlocked until this dagger is placed into that keyhole once more (though a sealed door or container can still be broken, bypassing the lock). Sealing a keyhole unseals any keyholes previously sealed with this weapon.</p>

			<p>This striking satin jacket allows you to make the most of your dying moments. When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this doublet, you do not fall unconscious. Instead, you are incapacitated and your speed becomes 0, but you can speak and communicate.</p>
			<p class="indent">You make death saving throws as normal, but if you roll a 1 on the d20, you swoon with a loud gasp and die instantly.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This dull-blue river stone is soft to the touch, and makes remarkably little sound if dropped. When an echo stone is squeezed as an action, it glows faintly for 1 minute. The stone records all sound made within 15 feet of it while glowing, then repeats that recorded sound at an equal volume once every 5 minutes. This cycle of repetition continues until the stone is squeezed again as an action, which silences it. Squeezing the stone twice in quick succession as an action causes it to play the sounds it has most recently recorded, rather than recording new sounds.</p>

	<element name="Graz'tchar, the Decadent End" type="Magic Item" source="Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn" id="ID_CRDP_TCSR_MAGIC_ITEM_GRAZTCHAR_THE_DECADENT_END">
		<description>
			<p>This blade appears to be a beautiful cruciform sword of shining silver, inlaid with sparkling rubies. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the following properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Corrosive Submission.</em></strong> When you hit a creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher with an attack using this sword, the target takes an extra 3d6 acid damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. If you attack the creature again while it is charmed in this way, the extra acid damage increases to 10d6 and the charmed condition ends. If the target succeeds on its saving throw or the charm ends for it, it can't be charmed again in this way for 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hidden Nature.</em></strong> The acid damage dealt by this greatsword appears to be radiant damage to all who perceive it. A true seeing spell or similar magic reveals that the sword is actually a rusted, pitted blade dripping with acid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> Graz'tchar is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Anyone who holds it hears the wise voice of a sorrowful king, beckoning the user to seize their destiny. A creature that succeeds on a DC 26 Wisdom (Insight) check while listening to the blade's voice hears a sliver of malice that suggests the truth: the voice is a corrupting trick of the Demon Prince of Indulgence.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Graz'tchar slowly attempts to sway its wielder to sow chaos in Exandria, telling lies and spreading malign truths about great leaders, and claiming that the members of the Tal'Dorei Council are corrupt and must be overthrown. The voice of this blade is actually the Demon Prince of Indulgence, speaking from his Abyssal prison.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the sword's attuned wielder disobeys the urges of the weapon for an extended period of time, Graz'tchar can attempt to control the wielder, who must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by the sword for 24 hours. While the wielder is charmed in this way, the sword can compel them to take an action of the sword's choice once per hour, though the wielder believes this action is taken of their own free will. If the chosen action leads to the harm of someone the wielder considers a trusted friend or ally, the charmed condition immediately ends. On a successful saving throw or if the charmed condition ends for the wielder, they are immune to this property of the sword for 24 hours.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This braided cord is dull bronze in color, ends in a splayed set of three barbs, and gleams like metal under any light. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a reach of 20 feet. When you hit a creature or object using this whip, you can attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you have a creature grappled using this whip, you can use your action to either pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you, or cause the creature to be restrained until you let go of the whip. A creature restrained in this way can escape by making a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action. The DC of this check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.</p>

		<description>
			<p>An executioner's blade from the Age of Arcanum, this magic greatsword is one of many similar weapons once used to execute magic-wielding criminals. Though most commonly found in the lands now known as Wildemount and Issylra, a few such blades have found their way to Tal'Dorei.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can cast the <i>dispel magic</i> spell from the sword against the target as part of the attack. Alternatively, you can use an action to cast <i>dispel magic</i> from the sword against a target of your choice. If you need to make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier as part of casting the spell, you make this check with a +3 modifier or your own spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is higher.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you cast dispel magic using this weapon, you can't do so again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These silver hand mirrors always come in pairs. When activated as an action, a mirror establishes a visual link with its paired mirror for 10 minutes, with the two mirrors acting as opposite sides of the same open window. The mirrors create this connection even if both are on different planes.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a single mirror of infinite transpondence is found, the GM decides where its paired mirror is and who possesses it. A random possessor and location can be determined by rolling on the table below. Named bearers are described in chapter 2.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the connection between the two mirrors has been activated three times from either end, it can't be activated again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>his black crystal pendant is a magical gateway to a small pocket dimension. You can use the pendant as an improvised weapon to make a melee or ranged weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped within the crystal. A creature that wants to be trapped can intentionally fail this saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">Only one creature at a time can be held in a raven's slumber. That creature is aware of the passage of time and can see the world outside of this talisman as if through a window. You can release a held creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a companion creature granted to you by a class feature, or a beast that you've tamed as a companion, is reduced to 0 hit points while within 100 feet of you, it is immediately drawn into the pendant and stabilized. If the pendant already holds a creature, this effect fails.</p>

A creature holding this rod can speak the name of any simple or martial weapon aloud as a bonus action, causing the rod to transform into an ordinary weapon of that type. When in the form of a ranged weapon, this rod magically creates its own ammunition, which disappears after a ranged attack hits or misses.</p>

You can attempt to attune to the lantern again and repeat the check to bond with the elemental during a short or long rest, but you make this check with disadvantage until you have made amends to the spirit, as the GM determines.</p>

			<p>These bat-like wings were first used by the Air Ashari to soar through the sky. They are constructed of either leather and bone, or cloth and wood, and are set onto a sturdy wooden pole that helps their user remain stable during flight.</p>
			<p class="indent">While these wings are open and you are riding the <i>skysail</i>, you can glide through the air. You have a flying speed of 60 feet, but you must descend at least 10 feet by the end of each of your turns and you can't gain altitude.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, while in contact with the <i>skysail</i>, you can use an action to cast the <i>fly</i> spell on yourself, with a duration of 1 minute and requiring no concentration.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell ends if you lose physical contact with the <i>skysail</i>. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, or unless the <i>skysail</i> is immersed in powerful magic of elemental air. (This includes magic such as that found at the top of the Summit Peaks near the rift of air in Zephrah, or on the Elemental Plane of Air).</p>
			<p class="indent">When the <i>skysail</i> is not in use, its wings can be retracted, and its pole can be used as a quarterstaff.</p>

			<p>When you don this circlet of gnarled onyx, black barbs dig into your head, imparting power to you as the circlet twists your appearance to amuse The Spider Queen. The current resting place of the <i>Circlet of Barbed Vision</i> is unknown, but rumor has it that a spectral assassin known as the Inevitable End seeks this relic.</p>
			<h5>Dormant</h5>
			<p>While the <i>Circlet of Barbed Vision</i> is in a dormant state, you have advantage on initiative rolls while you wear it, but your Charisma score decreases by 2. Your Charisma score returns to normal if you remove the circlet, but you take 4d6 psychic damage when you do so.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you make an attack roll, you can use your reaction to gain a +5 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the GM says whether the attack hits or misses. You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<h5>Awakened</h5>
			<p>When the <i>Circlet of Barbed Vision</i> reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have resistance to poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.</li>
				<li>Your ability to gain a bonus to an attack roll can be used twice between rests.</li>

		<description>
			<p>The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver longsword is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. <i>Star Razor</i>â€”known also as Dwueth'varâ€”was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the Calamity, but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in Wildemount.</p>
			<h5>Dormant</h5>
			<p>While <i>Star Razor</i> is in a dormant state, you can hold this magic longsword and use a bonus action to speak the command word Galas-var, causing the sword to emit a pale blue glow that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>While this longsword is glowing, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, and you have resistance to radiant damage.</li>
				<li>You can cast the <i>faerie fire</i> spell from the weapon as an action, requiring no components (save DC 13). Once a spell has been cast using <i>Star Razor</i>, that spell can't be cast from the sword until the next dawn.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Awakened</h5>
			<p>When <i>Star Razor</i> reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.</li>
				<li>When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to create a burst of radiance from the sword, dealing 1d8 radiant damage to the attacker.</li>
				<li>You can cast the <i>see invisibility</i> spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 15.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Exalted</h5>
			<p>When <i>Star Razor</i> reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.</li>
				<li>The burst of radiance you can create as a reaction when hit with a melee attack deals 1d12 radiant damage, and you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you as part of the same reaction.</li>
				<li>You can cast the <i>fly</i> spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 17.</li>

		<description>
			<p>Forged with a mercurial metal accidentally drawn from the Realms Beyond, this dagger shimmers with an unsettling sourceless light. It was once wielded by Vax'ildan, a legendary champion of the Matron of Ravens. Two raven feathers are linked to its pommel as a memento of its former bearer.</p>
			<h5>Dormant</h5>
			<p>While <i>Whisper</i> is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you score a critical hit with this dagger, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, the target is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
			<h5>Awakened</h5>
			<p>When <i>Whisper</i> reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this dagger, the target takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage.</li>

			<h5>Exalted</h5>
			<p>When <i>Whisper</i> reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:</p>

				<li>The DC to resist being frightened from a critical hit increases to 17.</li>
				<li>When this dagger is used to make a ranged attack, you can choose to transform into shadow and merge with the blade as part of the action used to attack, teleporting to another location. If the attack hits, you appear in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of the target. If the attack misses, you appear where the GM determines the dagger lands (typically within 1d6 Ã— 5 feet of the target). In either case, you appear with the dagger in your hand.</li>
