		<description>
			<p>Barbarians who follow the Path of the Juggernaut stand so resolutely that none can deter them, and they swing their weapons with such force that all who stand against them are flung aside. In might and in spirit, juggernauts are immovable object and unstoppable force all at once.</p>
			<p class="indent">Juggernaut barbarians can be found all over Tal'Dorei, and are common among the goliath warriors of the Rivermaw herd that wanders the Dividing Plains. Some dwarves and humanoid survivalists of the Cliffkeep Mountains adopt this fighting style as an extension of their rugged determinism. And a number of stalwart juggernauts hail from the jungles of the Rifenmist Peninsula, having cast off the oppressive yoke of the Iron Authority.</p>

			<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage instills you with the strength to shove and smash your way through your foes, making any battlefield your domain. When you hit a creature with a melee attack while you're raging, you can push that creature up to 5 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. A creature that is Huge or larger makes a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a success, the creature is not pushed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Starting at 10th level, you can push a creature up to 10 feet when you hit it with a melee attack while you're raging.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Rules Tip: Forced Movement</h5>
				<p>Usually when one creature moves out of a hostile creature's reach, the hostile creature can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack. However, forced movement—such as being pushed by a Path of the Juggernaut barbarian's Thunderous Blows feature—doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
				<p class="indent">Likewise, a juggernaut barbarian's Hurricane Strike feature allows an ally to make a melee weapon attack as a reaction only if the foe ends its forced movement within 5 feet of the ally. If a foe is pushed through other spaces within 5 feet of your allies, those allies can't make normal opportunity attacks against the foe.</p>

			<p>Also at 6th level, you can temporarily refocus your combat ability to make yourself a bulwark of defense. At the start of your turn (no action required), you can assume a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in this stance, you can't be grappled, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and your weapon attacks are made with disadvantage.</p>

This leap costs no movement and does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
