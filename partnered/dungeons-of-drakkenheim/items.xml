		<description>
			<p>A character cannot attune to more than one <i>Seal of Drakkenheim</i>. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as <b>wall gargoyles</b> and <b>tower dragons</b> do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the <i>Seals of Drakkenheim</i>. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you may present a <i>Seal of Drakkenheim</i> to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each <b>wall gargoyle</b> or <b>tower dragon</b> that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.</p>

	<element name="Relics of Saint Vitruvio" type="Information" source="Dungeons Of Drakkenheim" id="ID_GFG_DOD_INFORMATION_RELICS_OF_SAINT_VITRUVIO">
		<description>
			<p>These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.</p>
			<p class="indent">A character attuned to three <i>Relics of Saint Vitruvio</i> may cast the heal spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both <i>Relics of Saint Vitruvio</i>.</p>

			<p>Delerium is a magical mineral left behind by the meteor. It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals which reflect octarine light.

Deposits are found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This purple potion glows dimly with octarine light. It swirls and sparkles in its small stoppered bottle.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you drink this potion, you regain expended spell slots. Roll 1d6 - you choose spell slots to regain that have a combined level that is equal to or less than the result. None of the slots can be higher than 5th level.</p>
			<p class="indent">For one hour after drinking <i>aqua delerium</i>, roll 1d20 each time you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. On a 1, you trigger a random arcane anomaly (see <i>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</i>).</p>
			<p class="indent">If you consume more than one dose of <i>aqua delerium</i> before finishing your next long rest, you take (1d12) necrotic damage for each spell level regained, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until you finish a long rest. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a creature who cannot cast spells using spell slots drinks <i>aqua delerium</i>, it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gains one level of contamination.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This bright orange fluid is stored in a syringe and charged with arcane magic. You can use an action to administer the shot directly to the heart of yourself or another willing creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">You are protected against contamination for six hours after receiving a dose of <i>aqua expurgo</i>. During this time, whenever you fail a saving throw against an effect that would cause you to gain one or more contamination levels, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this ability three times, after which the effects of <i>aqua expurgo</i> expire.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the effects of <i>aqua expurgo</i> expire in this manner, you immediately take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and become incapacitated for 1 minute while you violently retch corrupt bile. Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You die if this effect reduces your hit point maximum to 0. The necrotic damage can't be reduced or prevented by any means.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This spherical glass orb contains an ignited delerium shard hovering gently within. Electrical currents of yellow, green, and purple energy streak from the crystal and cascade along the glass, rendering it warm to the touch.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action you can throw the orb up to 30 feet. It shatters on impact, releasing a 20-foot-radius burst of contaminated energy. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or take (8d6) necrotic damage, and take one level of contamination. In addition, an arcane anomaly occurs, centred on the point of impact.</p>

			<p>A character may only attune to the <i>Crown of Westemär</i> by performing a special one hour ceremony with six other characters who are each attuned to a different <i>Seal of Drakkenheim</i>. See the "Developments" section in <strong>Chapter 9: Castle Drakken</strong> for details on this ritual.</p>
			<p class="indent">The crown has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the <i>wish</i> spell from it. The crown regains one expended charge every ten years.</p>
			<p class="indent">The ancient bronze dragon Minazorond, the tower dragons, and the wall gargoyles are under your control and obey your spoken commands while you wear the crown.</p>
			<p class="indent">While wearing the crown and seated on the <i>Throne of Drakkenheim</i> in Castle Drakken, you may use an action to communicate telepathically with one dragon or twelve gargoyles so long as they are within 100 miles of Castle Drakken. When you do, you can issue commands to those creatures, see through one of the creature's eyes, and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This sacred weapon was forged to burn away deception and darkness. Blazing embers gently fall from the silver blade, first ignited by the brazier in the Temple of Lumen.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to speak the sword's name, causing radiant flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 4d6 radiant damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to douse the blade, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> Ignacious is a sentient lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 19, and a Charisma of 23. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, Celestial, and Draconic, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. It always knows its wielder's thoughts. Its voice is commanding, righteous, and booming. When drawn, Ignacious casts the <i>zone of truth</i> spell (save DC 20), and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to. The zone of truth moves with the blade and remains centred on it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Ignacious is zealously devoted to the Sacred Flame, and has memorized every word of its holy texts. The blade wishes to be wielded by a faithful devotee of any sort; Ignacious does not care about the religious divide between the Falling Fire and the Sacred Flame so long as its wielder keeps the core tenets shared by both sects.</p>
			<p class="indent">The sword's purpose is to expose all deception and reveal the truth. It does not tolerate any falsehood, duplicitousness, or lies. The sword always knows when it hears a lie, and responds with wrathful fury. If a wielder speaks a lie, it immediately triggers a conflict.</p>
