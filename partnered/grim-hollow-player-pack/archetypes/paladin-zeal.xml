		<supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The Oath of Zeal is taken by paladins consumed by hatred for a specific group or ideology. Zealots, as these paladins are sometimes called, pursue an inquisition against their enemies at all costs. They abandon compassion and honor as impediments to the more important work of ridding the world of those they deem dangerous or heretical.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Tenets of Zeal</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of Zeal are serious and severe, as are those paladins who choose to take them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Uncover Corruption.</em></strong> Darkness cannot abide the light of day. Wickedness must be revealed before it can be destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Purge the Heretics.</em></strong> Heresy is a tumor that spread through the hearts of the innocent. Cut it out at the source.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>No Mercy.</em></strong> The righteous path requires unwavering conviction and unflinching resolve.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>By Any Means Necessary.</em></strong> There is no sacrifice too great when it comes to defeating the wicked.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mark of the Heretic.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to mark a creature as a heretic. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet and a weeping symbol appears on it. For the next minute, your weapon attacks against the chosen creature score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and each time the creature's turn starts you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Inquisitor's Eye.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to open your senses to hidden signs of corruption and malfeasance. As a bonus action, you grant yourself advantage on Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Insight), and Wisdom (Perception) ability checks for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you can't be surprised.</p>
