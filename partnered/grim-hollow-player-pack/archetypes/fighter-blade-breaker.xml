			<p>Fighters who emulate the legends of the Blade Breaker strive to be the embodiment of change. Their blade and warrior's spirit are tools through which they project their will upon the world in the form of martial magic. Many who follow the Saga of the Blade Breaker are stubborn, and would sooner force reality itself to bend before their desires than change their ways. Some are idealists, who have a vision for a better world and would do anything to achieve it. Others are tyrants, and see the world as putty to be molded, and all its inhabitants as mere hindrances to their ultimate glory.</p>

			<p>You have trained in the manner of heroes from the old sagas, and now you can perform certain martial maneuvers. A maneuver requires you to spend maneuver points to use it.</p>
			<p class="indent">You know three maneuvers of your choice from the list below. You learn additional maneuvers at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Each time you learn a maneuver, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one you can learn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Maneuver Points.</em></strong> Channeling the heroes from the old sagas is no easy task, and your pool of maneuver points represents the limit of your abilities to do so. Your class level determines the number of maneuver points you have, as shown in the Maneuver Points column in the Blade Breaker Chart below. You regain all spent maneuver points at the end of a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Using Maneuvers.</em></strong> You can use one maneuver during each turn. Some maneuvers require concentration, as if concentrating on a spell, or certain conditions to use. Some maneuvers will require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These maneuvers can be used by anyone who studies the Blade Breaker saga. Tales of the Blade Breaker focus on his relentless determination, which granted him seemingly inexhaustible strength and a mystical ability to shape reality.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Arcing Iron.</em></strong> You swing your weapon in a wide arc, catching additional foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more maneuver points to empower your next melee attack this turn. When you make that attack, make an additional attack against each additional creature within your reach, spending 1 maneuver point per additional creature targeted.</p>
			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Armor-Crushing Blows.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with an attack, if it is wearing armor, you can spend 4 maneuver points and deal no damage with that attack. Instead, the target must make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their armor is damaged. A creature with damage armor has its AC reduced by 2. If this maneuver is used on damaged armor, that armor is destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable. This maneuver has no effect on natural or magical armor.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blade Breaking Blow.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with an attack, if it is wielding a weapon, you can spend 4 maneuver points and deal no damage with that attack. Instead, the target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, one of their weapons is damaged. A damaged weapon deals half as much damage. If this maneuver is used on a damaged weapon, that weapon is destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable. This maneuver has no effect on natural or magical weapons.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blade of Eternal Demise.</em></strong> As an action, you can spend 3 maneuver points and imbue your weapon with magic and declare a single creature. For the next 8 hours, that weapon is magical and if it deals damage to the declared creature, it also reduces the target's maximum hit points by same amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the declared creature dies from damage dealt by the imbued weapon, it cannot be returned to life by magic for as long as the weapon is touching the creature.</p>
			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Commanding Grasp.</em></strong> As an action, you can spend 2 maneuver points and attempt to grab a creature at a distance. Choose a creature of your size or smaller within 30 feet that you can see. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space next to you and become grappled by you.</p>
			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Contest of Wills.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can spend 1 maneuver point to face down a creature you can see that can see you in a contest of wills. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Charisma (Intimidation). The creature that succeeds has advantage on attack rolls against the other creature until the end of its next turn.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Disarming Swipe.</em></strong> You can target your foe's weapon instead of their body. When you hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 maneuver points and deal no damage with that attack. Instead, the target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be disarmed. A disarmed creature drops any weapons or shields it is holding.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Helmsplitter.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with an attack, you can spend 4 maneuver points and that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of its next turn. If you had advantage on the attack, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Iron Tempest.</em></strong> As an action, you can spend 4 maneuver points and make a weapon attack against a creature. Until the end of your turn, whenever you hit with a weapon attack, it deals 2d6 additional damage and you can make an additional number of attacks equal to your proficiency bonus, but each bonus attack must be against a different target.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Refusal to Bleed.</em></strong> As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 maneuver point to roll a d10. Add your fighter level to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the triggering damage is from an attack, you can spend 3 additional maneuver points to reduce all damage from the creature that attacked you by the same total until the start of your next turn.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Steely Determination.</em></strong> When you use your Second Wind, you can spend 1 maneuver point and regain an additional number of hit points equal to your fighter level.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unstoppable Missle.</em></strong> As an action, you can spend 2 maneuver points and throw a melee weapon you are wielding, affecting an area the size of a 5-foot-wide line that is 30 feet long. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to one roll of that weapon's damage dice plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
			<p class="indent">For each creature that takes damage from this maneuver, you can spend 1 maneuver point and that creature takes an additional 2d6 damage of the weapon's type.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wall of Blades.</em></strong> When you are hit with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction and spend 2 maneuver points to make a weapon attack against the creature attacking you. You can replace your AC with the result of this attack roll until the beginning of your next turn, including against the triggering attack, potentially causing it to miss.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, your martial training allows you to develop a battle stance, chosen from the list below. You gain an additional stance when you reach 7th, 10th, and 15th level in this class.</p>

The creature that attacked you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from you.</p>
			<p class="indent">At 18th level, the creature is pushed up to 10 feet instead.</p>
