		<description>
			<p>This mask is covered with scales and depicts the typical features of a chromatic dragon. These masks are often adorned with bone horns, feathers, or even gems. Once attuned to a particular mask, the wearer gains damage resistance and a minor breath weapon; the type depends on the mask's color.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Breath Weapon (Recharge 6).</em></strong> The mask wearer can use an action to exhale a draconic breath weapon, causing 3d8 points of damage. The range is a S-foot-by-30-foot line effect (for black and blue masks) or a 15-foot cone (for green, red, and white masks), and the damage type is determined by the mask's color. A target can attempt a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage to half.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This syrupy oil is typically stored in a clay or stone pot. If the oil is liberally applied (one dose is enough for a Medium-sized creature) to a creature that has been turned to stone (such as by the petrifying gaze of a medusa), the petrification effect ends, and the target is returned to flesh.</p>

	<element name="Helm of Opposite Alignment" type="Magic Item" source="Original Adventures Reincarnated #1: Into the Borderlands" id="ID_GMG_OAR1_MAGIC_ITEM_HELM_OF_OPPOSITE_ALIGNMENT">
		<description>
			<p>This appears to be a typical metal cap or helm. It radiates a faint magical dweomer. If held and examined for more than a few moments, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, or place the helm on its head, triggering the curse.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Once a creature places the helm on its head, the curse takes effect immediately. The creature's alignment shifts to the radical opposite: good to evil, law to chaos, and neutral to an absolute commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Unless a <i>remove curse</i> spell is cast within 10 minutes of placing the helm on its head, only a <i>wish</i> spell can break the enchantment, allowing the helm to be removed and returning the creature's alignment to its original state.</p>

	<element name="Staff of Stone" type="Magic Item" source="Original Adventures Reincarnated #1: Into the Borderlands" id="ID_GMG_OAR1_MAGIC_ITEM_STAFF_OF_STONE">
		<description>
			<p>This staff is about 6 feet long, and appears to be fashioned from a thin stony stalactite which glistens with moisture and has a ball-like head composed of glittery mica. Although it appears heavy and unwieldy, it's actually dry, cool to the touch, and quite light.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once attuned to the device, the staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">The staff has 21 charges that can be used to power the spells listed below. The staff regains ld6 + 1 charges weekly as long as it is in contact with a stony surface. If the last charge is expended, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff regains 1d6 + 1 charges. On a 2-4, the staff becomes inert for 1 day and loses 1d6 + 1 charges. On a 20, the staff crumbles and becomes a worthless pile of rubble.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Spells.</strong> While holding this staff and using an action, 1 or more of its charges can be used to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: <i>blade ward</i> (1 charge), <i>passwall</i> (5 charges), <i>stone shape</i> (4 charges), or <i>wall of stone</i> (5 charges).</p>
