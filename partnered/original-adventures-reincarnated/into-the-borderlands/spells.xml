	<element name="Directional Confusion" type="Spell" source="Original Adventures Reincarnated #1: Into the Borderlands" id="ID_GMG_OAR1_SPELL_DIRECTIONAL_CONFUSION">
		<supports>Wizard, Spell Saving Throw</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This spell of confusion is typically placed on a small labyrinth or series of dungeon corridors, to assault and twist a creature's sense of direction. Each creature that enters the 120-foot radius sphere enchanted with this spell is required to make a Wisdom saving throw. Success indicates the creacure is immune to the effects of this casting of the spell for 1 hour. Failure results in the loss of all sense of direction: right becomes confused with left, north and south become mixed up, etc. The DM should randomly determine which direction a creature goes despice its instructions, even if the random direction doesn't make sense - such is the enchantment.</p>
			<p class="indent">After every 10 minuces spent in the area of effect, a creature can attempt another Wisdom saving throw.</p>

	<element name="Fright" type="Spell" source="Original Adventures Reincarnated #1: Into the Borderlands" id="ID_GMG_OAR1_SPELL_FRIGHT">
		<supports>Wizard, Spell Attack, Spell Saving Throw</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Your touch can project a horrid image. Make a melee spell attack against a creature. On a hit, the target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration of the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">When frightened, the creature must take the Dash action and move away from the caster by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful saving throw the spell ends for that creature.</p>
