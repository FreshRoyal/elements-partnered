		<description>
			<p class="flavor">“Yes, it is Elves," said Frodo. "One can meet them sometimes in the Woody End.”</p>
			<p>The Fair Folk of Eriador have dwelt in the Westlands since before the drowning of Beleriand. They are all members of the Firstborn, displaying a wisdom beyond the reach of Men. They rarely leave their sanctuaries in the Grey Havens, for these are their fading years.</p>
			<p class="indent">More and more leave Middle-earth sailing West on grey ships, never to return. Those who still remain live mostly along the western coasts, where once were found great kingdoms of their kindred.</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>All Elves are endowed with tremendous vitality and great vigour. They are not subject to illness or old age, and thus can dwell within the circles of the world until they choose to leave it, or are slain.</p>
			<p class="indent">In battle, most Elves carry bows and spears. Many wield swords too, but by ancient tradition some still favour axes.</p>
			<h4>Typical Names</h4>
			<p>For the most part, Elves bear names fashioned in their own, fair tongue–the Sindarin speech.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Sample Female Names:</strong> Aranel, Arbereth, Berúthiel, Baraniel, Calanril, Celenneth, Elnîth, Eraniel, Finduilas, Gilraen, Gilraeth, Gloredhel, Idril, Ioreth, Ivorwen, Lôrwend, Lothíriel, Luindîs, Meneloth, Moriel, Morwen, Narieth, Narniel, Orothêl, Tarandîs.</li>
				<li><strong>Sample Male Names:</strong> Amras, Aredhel, Beleganor, Belegon, Calanhir, Carmagor, Dagorhir, Durandir, Edrahil, Ellahir, Fincalan, Fuindor, Galdagor, Galdor, Hallas, Hirimlad, Ithildir, Lascalan, Linaith, Mablin, Malanor, Nauros, Orgalad, Pelegorn, Sargon.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cultural Traits</h4>
			<p>Your character gains the following benefits based on their cultural heritage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Adventuring Age.</em></strong> 100–500. Elves may leave their homes at any time after they reach adulthood (at about a century of age). Adventurers older than 300 years are rare, as in time all Elves find the sea-longing that lies deep within their hearts to become irresistible.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Elves have slender builds and are taller than most Men, standing well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Elvish Dreams.</em></strong> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit as from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Elven-Skill.</em></strong> By virtue of their birthright, Elves are capable of reaching levels of finesse unattainable by mortals. If you are not miserable and make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can obtain a magical success. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Immortal Folk.</em></strong> You are immune to ageing and disease.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Keen Eyes of the Elves.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill, and dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Westron and Sindarin, the Grey-elven tongue.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subculture.</em></strong> All Elves display the traits described so far, but the Fair Folk have experienced many sunderings since the Elder Days. In this book, only the Elves of Lindon subculture is available. Future supplements will introduce new subcultures of Elves.</p>
