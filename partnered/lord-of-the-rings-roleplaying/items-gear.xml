		<description>
			<p>Cram is a biscuitish cake that keeps good indefinitely, made by the Bardings for long journeys. Albeit certainly not entertaining (and in fact, mostly a chewing exercise), it is doubtlessly sustaining and very nutritious: one pound of cram counts as two pounds of food.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you are a Barding (or you have been taught the recipe by a Barding) and you are proficient with cook's utensils, during each Fellowship Phase you can prepare a number of cram rations equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus (10 times your proficiency bonus during a Yule Fellowship Phase), or twice as much if a feature lets you add double your proficiency bonus with cook's utensils.</p>
