			<p>Beauty can both bend minds and inspire hearts. It is the force that compels others to lose control and give in to their impulses, but it can also awaken strength and determination to steel a forlorn heart.</p>
			<p class="indent">Clerics of Beauty bring joy and hope to the world. They are the beacon of light that reminds us that some things are worth fighting for. They seek to bring peace and amity among the world's folk. They fight only when they must, and prefer to use their magic to end fights with as little bloodshed as possible.</p>
